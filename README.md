# Wordle in less than 30 lines of PowerShell

I was inspired by ["Wordle in less than 50 lines of Bash"](https://gist.github.com/huytd/6a1a6a7b34a0d0abcac00b47e3d01513) to see what I could do in PowerShell.

The PowerShell version is only 30 lines (50 for Bash) and easier to understand.

How to use:
```
./wordle.ps1
```

Or try the unlimit mode:
```
./wordle.ps1 unlimit
```
